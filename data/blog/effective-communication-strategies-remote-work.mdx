summary: "In a remote work environment, effective communication is vital for maintaining productivity and team cohesion. This article outlines a three-step approach to keep everyone in the loop: sharing investigation or progress results, outlining next steps, and asking clear verification questions. These practices help ensure transparency, streamline task management, and make revisiting tasks more efficient. While it may seem cumbersome initially, incorporating these habits greatly enhances remote work efficiency and collaboration."

Over-communicating is crucial when working remotely, both synchronously and asynchronously. Here’s a method I’ve been learning to keep everyone in the loop, especially useful for those like me who find context switching challenging. It involves three steps, which I sometimes skip when in a rush, but here’s the ideal process:

## 1. Investigation / Progress Results

Even small updates are valuable to track progress. Before switching to another task, take 5-10 minutes to jot down what you’ve found or accomplished.

*Example:* "Based on the bug description, I’ve investigated pages a, b, and c but haven’t been able to reproduce the issue yet."

## 2. Next Steps

Outline what you plan to do next. This helps when you return to the task.

*Example:* "I will ask the support team about the account used to reproduce this bug."

## 3. Verification Questions (Expect Yes/No Answers when Blocked)

Pose clear questions to verify assumptions or clarify blockers.

*Example:* "From the recording, the user seems to have role X. Is that correct?"

## 4. Tag the Right People

Remember to mention the relevant people or points of contact (POC) at the start or after posing a question. Ensure you’re clear about whom you need to involve and why.

*Examples:*
1. "Hi @Ence, I'm working on this issue, and I’ve made progress on X and Y. Does this align with your expectations?"
2. "Hi @Ence, I’m currently handling this task. Is it okay if I proceed with this approach?"

Also, don’t forget to CC anyone who might have valuable input or could potentially help.

## 5. If Your Investigation Is Really Long, Add a TLDR

For lengthy updates, include a "Too Long; Didn't Read" (TLDR) summary at the top. This helps readers quickly grasp the key points without sifting through extensive details.

*Example TLDR:* "TLDR: Investigated pages a, b, c; issue not reproduced yet. Next steps: consult support team about account details."

## Why Is This Important?

### 1. Remote Work Transparency

We don’t always know what’s happening on our colleagues’ end. Centralizing communication through ticket comments helps track our work and makes it easier for others to follow our progress.

### 2. Efficiency in Review

When revisiting tasks, having detailed logs means less time spent figuring out what the ticket was about, as the comment history already provides comprehensive information.

This method not only keeps everyone aligned but also makes remote work smoother and more efficient.
