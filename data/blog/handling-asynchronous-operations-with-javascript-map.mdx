## Introduction

JavaScript’s map method is great for transforming arrays, but when combined with asynchronous functions, it can be confusing. You might end up with an array of unresolved promises instead of the actual data. This article explains the problem and how to use Promise.all to get the data you need.

## The Problem

Consider an asynchronous function that fetches data based on an ID. You use map to apply this function to multiple IDs:

```javascript
const fetchData = async (id) => {
  // Simulate an API call
  return { id, data: `Data for ${id}` };
};

const ids = [1, 2, 3];

const results = ids.map(fetchData);
console.log(results); // Logs: [Promise, Promise, Promise]
```
Here, results is an array of promises, not the actual data. This is because map doesn’t wait for the promises to resolve.

## Why Does This Happen?

map applies a function to each element and returns a new array. When the function is asynchronous, map just returns an array of promises because it doesn't wait for these promises to resolve.

The Solution

To handle this, use Promise.all, which takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all promises have resolved.

Here’s how you can modify the example:

```javascript
const fetchData = async (id) => {
  // Simulate an API call
  return { id, data: `Data for ${id}` };
};

const ids = [1, 2, 3];

const results = await Promise.all(ids.map(fetchData));
console.log(results); // Logs: [{ id: 1, data: 'Data for 1' }, { id: 2, data: 'Data for 2' }, { id: 3, data: 'Data for 3' }]
```
With Promise.all, all promises are resolved before you get the final array of data.

## Key Takeaways

Understanding map with Async Functions: When map is used with async functions, it returns an array of promises, not resolved values.
Using Promise.all: To get resolved values, use Promise.all. It waits for all promises to resolve and returns their results.
Conclusion

Combining map with async functions in JavaScript requires handling promises carefully. Using Promise.all ensures that you get the resolved data, avoiding common pitfalls. Understanding this pattern will help you write more reliable and efficient asynchronous code.
