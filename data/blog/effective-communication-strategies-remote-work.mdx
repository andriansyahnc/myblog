Effective communication is crucial for remote work, where digital connections replace physical presence. Here’s a practical three-step method I’ve found invaluable for keeping everyone in the loop, especially for those who struggle with context switching. While it's easy to skip these steps in a rush, following this process ensures clarity and efficiency:

## 1. Track Progress

Even minor updates matter. Before switching tasks, spend a few minutes documenting what you’ve achieved or discovered.

Example: "Investigated pages a, b, and c based on the bug description, but couldn’t reproduce the issue."

## 2. Outline Next Steps

Clearly state what you plan to do next. This helps you and others understand what needs to be done when you revisit the task.

Example: "Next, I will reach out to the support team about the account used for reproducing this bug."

## 3. Ask Verification Questions

Pose specific questions to clarify assumptions or identify blockers. These should be easy to answer with a yes or no.

Example: "From the recording, it looks like the user has role X. Is this correct?"

## 4. Tag Relevant People

Mention the appropriate contacts when necessary. Ensure you’re clear about who needs to be involved and why.

Examples:

"Hi @Ence, I’ve made progress on X and Y. Does this align with your expectations?"
"Hi @Ence, I’m working on this task. Is it okay if I proceed with this approach?"
Also, CC anyone who might provide valuable input or assistance.

## 5. Add a TLDR for Long Updates

For lengthy updates, include a "Too Long; Didn’t Read" (TLDR) summary at the top to quickly convey the key points.

Example TLDR: "TLDR: Investigated pages a, b, c; issue not reproduced yet. Next: consult support team about account details."

## Why This Matters

### 1. Enhance Remote Work Transparency
Centralizing communication helps track work progress and makes it easier for team members to follow along, especially when working remotely.

### 2. Boost Efficiency in Reviews
Detailed logs reduce the time needed to understand the status of tasks, as the comment history provides all the necessary context.

By embracing these practices, you can improve remote collaboration and make your remote work experience smoother and more productive.
