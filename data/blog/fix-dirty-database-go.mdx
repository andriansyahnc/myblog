### Introduction

A dirty database state occurs when a migration fails mid-way, leaving the database in an inconsistent state. This can block further migrations until the issue is resolved. In this guide, we will show you how to programmatically fix a dirty database using a Go script with the `golang-migrate` package.

By the end of this article, you'll know how to force a migration version in Go, clearing the dirty state and allowing further migrations to be executed smoothly.

### Why Does a Database Become Dirty?

A dirty database often occurs due to:

- Partial failures during migrations (e.g., network issues, syntax errors).
- Manual schema changes that mismatch with migrations.
- Incomplete or failed rollback operations.

When a migration fails, the database becomes “dirty,” preventing future migrations until you address the issue and force the version.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Fix a Dirty Database with Go

#### 1. Install the `golang-migrate` Package

First, you need to install the `golang-migrate` package, which will help you handle database migrations:

```bash
go get -u github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4
```

Make sure to also install the necessary drivers for your database. For example, for MySQL:

```bash
go get -u github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/mysql
```

#### 2. Create a Go Script to Force the Migration Version

Now, let's create a Go script that will force the migration version and clear the dirty state: (fix_migration.go)

```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4"
	_ "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/mysql"
	_ "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source/file"
	"log"
	"strconv"
)

var (
	commit  string
	builtAt string
)

func main() {
	// load environment

	versionStr := flag.String("version", "", "Migration version to force (required)")

	flag.Parse()

	// Check if required flags are provided
	if *versionStr == "" {
		log.Fatalf("Error: You must provide a migration version to force using the -version flag")
	}

	forcedVersion, err := strconv.Atoi(*versionStr)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Invalid version number provided: %v", err)
	}

	err = database.InitDBTables()
	if err != nil {
		logger.Error().Println(err)
	}

	connectionString := cfg.BuildDbConnString()

	m, err := migrate.New(
		"file://migrations", // Path to migration files
		"mysql://"+connectionString,
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Run migration up
	err = m.Force(forcedVersion)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to force migration version: %v", err)
	}

	log.Printf("Successfully forced migration version to: %d\n", forcedVersion)
}

```

#### 3. How It Works

- Flags: The -version flags allow you to specify the version number you want to force.
- Error Handling: The script checks if the -version flag is missing and ensures the provided version is a valid integer.
- Migration Logic: Once the script connects to the database, it forces the migration version and clears the dirty state.

#### 4. Running the Script

```
go run fix_migration.go -version=20240924005347
```

If you don't pass the -version flag, the script will exit with an error, prompting you to provide it.

### Best Practices
- Backup Your Database: Always back up your database before forcing a migration, especially if you're working in a production environment.
- Check for Schema Conflicts: Before forcing the migration, ensure that the schema aligns with what the migration expects.
- Use Transactional Migrations: If possible, run migrations in a transactional manner, so a failed migration rolls back automatically.

### Conclusion
By following the steps in this article, you can quickly and safely fix a dirty database state using a Go script and the golang-migrate package. This approach helps avoid manual intervention and ensures smooth execution of future migrations.

With this solution, you no longer need to worry about blocked migrations due to dirty states, keeping your database healthy and ready for updates.
