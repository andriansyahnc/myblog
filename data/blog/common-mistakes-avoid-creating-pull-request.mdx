### Common Mistakes to Avoid When Creating a Pull Request

In today’s fast-paced development environment, version control systems have become an inseparable part of our daily workflow. They make maintaining codebases more efficient, collaborative, and organized. However, even though we use them every day, there are still some common pitfalls when creating pull requests (PRs) or merge requests (MRs). Let’s dive into a few of these and how to avoid them.

#### 1. Overloading the PR

One of the most frequent mistakes is submitting a PR that’s overloaded with too many changes or, worse, multiple unrelated tasks. This makes it hard for reviewers to follow what’s going on and increases the chances of missing important details. The solution? **Keep it focused.** A PR should address one specific task or issue, making it easier to review, understand, and ultimately merge.

#### 2. Poor Commit History

Let’s be honest: documenting isn’t every developer’s favorite activity. We’ve all been there—naming variables after food like “Nasi Goreng” because we’re hungry, staring at a looming deadline, and have a user hovering over our shoulder. But when it comes to commit history, it’s worth taking the time to write clear, meaningful messages. Instead of vague comments like “Fixing stuff” or “WIP,” aim to provide a concise description of what each commit does. This not only helps others understand your changes but also makes it easier to track down issues later.

#### 3. Lack of Context in Description

A common mistake is assuming that your reviewer knows everything you do about the PR. This can lead to a lack of context in the description, making it harder for others to grasp the full picture. Take a moment to explain what the PR is about, why it’s necessary, and any relevant background information. This will save everyone time and ensure a smoother review process.

#### 4. Skipping Tests

Testing is crucial, yet it’s often overlooked in the rush to get code out the door. Skipping tests can lead to bugs slipping through the cracks, causing headaches down the line. Make sure your changes are covered by appropriate tests, whether they’re unit tests, integration tests, or manual checks. This shows that you’ve thought through the potential impacts of your changes and care about the quality of your code.

#### 5. Not Reviewing Your Own Code

It’s tempting to submit a PR as soon as you’ve finished writing the code, but it’s worth taking a few extra minutes to review your own work. This can help you catch obvious errors, optimize logic, and ensure that your code is clean and ready for others to see. Remember, the better the code you submit, the smoother the review process will be.

#### 6. Failing to Communicate

Communication is key when working with a team, and this extends to PRs. Make sure to tag the right people, ask for specific feedback, and respond to comments promptly. Don’t leave conversations unresolved; instead, engage with your reviewers to address their concerns and improve your code.

#### 7. Pushing Unnecessary Files

We’ve all accidentally committed files that don’t belong in the repository—large binaries, temporary files, or even entire directories that shouldn’t be there. Before you hit “Create Pull Request,” double-check what you’re committing. Use `.gitignore` files to exclude unnecessary files and keep your repository clean and efficient.

### Conclusion

Creating a good pull request is as much about good habits as it is about good code. By avoiding these common mistakes, you’ll not only make the review process easier for your team but also contribute to a cleaner, more maintainable codebase. Happy coding!
