When you're starting with Git, it's normal to run into a few hiccups. Don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Here are some common Git mistakes and how you can fix them quickly.

### 1. Forgot to Add a File in Your Latest Commit

**What happened?** You committed your changes, but later realized you forgot to include a file.

**Solution:** No problem! You can easily add the missing file to your last commit without creating a new one. Just use:

```bash
git add <file>
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

This command adds the file to your most recent commit while keeping your commit message intact.

### 2. Remove an Unwanted File from Your Latest Commit

**What happened?** You accidentally committed a file that wasn’t supposed to be included.

**Solution:** You can remove the file from the commit but keep it in your working directory with:

```bash
git reset HEAD^ -- <file>
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

This removes the file from the commit as if it was never added, without altering the commit message.

### 3. Discard Local Changes

**What happened?** You made some local changes but then decided you don’t want them anymore.

**Solution:** If you haven’t committed the changes yet and you want to discard them, you can reset the files to their last committed state:

```bash
git checkout -- <file>
```

To discard all local changes and start fresh:

```bash
git reset --hard
```

Be cautious with this command—it will permanently remove all your uncommitted changes.

### 4. Pulling Failed Due to In-Progress Work

**What happened?** You tried to pull the latest changes from the remote repository, but Git blocked you because you have uncommitted changes.

**Solution:** Git wants you to handle your local changes first. You have two main options:

Stash Your Changes:
```bash
git stash
git pull
```
This temporarily saves your local changes, allowing you to pull the latest updates. After pulling, you can reapply your changes with:

```bash
git stash pop
```

Commit Your Work:
If your changes are ready, go ahead and commit them before pulling:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: work in progress"
git pull
```

This way, you can pull the latest updates without any issues.
