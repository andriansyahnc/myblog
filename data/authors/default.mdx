## 👨‍💻 About Me

**Backend Software Engineer** and **Technical Lead** who loves building distributed systems that actually scale. I specialise in microservices architecture, Node.js/TypeScript, and event-driven systems — and I've spent the last decade-and-a-half making sure those systems stay up at 3am so their owners don't have to.

Beyond the code, I care deeply about the people around it. I've had the privilege of leading engineering teams at Moladin, mentoring engineers who are now leading their own squads, and shipping features that reached hundreds of thousands of users worldwide. If there's a hard technical problem or a team that needs a bit of direction, I'm usually the one who sticks around to figure it out.

## 🏆 Things I'm Proud Of

- 🎯 **Never missed a critical deadline** — Delivered all P0 features on time, every single sprint. My team knows they can count on me.
- 📈 **Helped the team shine** — Our technical design reviews went from good to great. I'm proud of how everyone grew together.
- 👥 **Built and led amazing teams** — Had the privilege of working with 10+ talented engineers. Watching them grow has been the best part of my career.
- 🏗️ **Created systems that actually work** — Built microservices that handle millions of requests and are still running smoothly.
- 🚀 **Made migrations painless** — Migrated critical services with zero downtime. No 3am emergency calls, no angry users.
- 📊 **Performance matters** — Cut API response times by 80% on some services. Users notice the difference.

## 💡 What I Can Bring

**Technical Leadership** — I've led teams through complex projects and tight deadlines. I believe in empowering engineers and creating an environment where everyone can do their best work.

**System Design** — I love designing systems that scale. Microservices, event-driven architecture, you name it. But I also know when to keep things simple.

**Problem Solving** — Give me a bug or a performance issue, and I'll dig until I find the root cause. I'm persistent, sometimes to a fault.

**Mentorship** — Seeing engineers grow is what keeps me motivated. Knowledge sharing isn't just nice to have — it's essential.

**Communication** — I can talk tech with engineers and business with stakeholders. Bridging that gap is crucial for project success.
