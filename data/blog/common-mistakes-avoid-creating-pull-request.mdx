### Avoid These Common Pull Request Pitfalls
In today’s fast-paced development environment, version control systems are a daily essential, making it easier to maintain organized and collaborative codebases. But even with frequent use, mistakes when creating pull requests (PRs) or merge requests (MRs) are common. Let’s dive into a few of these pitfalls and how to avoid them.

#### 1. Overloading the PR

Submitting a PR with too many changes or unrelated tasks is a frequent error. This overwhelms reviewers and increases the risk of overlooked details. Keep PRs focused. Address one specific task or issue per PR to make the review process more manageable.

#### 2. Unclear Commit Messages

Commit history is often neglected, but clear, meaningful messages are crucial. Instead of vague comments like “Fixing stuff,” write concise descriptions of what each commit does. This clarity helps others understand your changes and makes it easier to track issues later.

#### 3. Lacking Context in PR Descriptions

Assuming your reviewer knows everything you do about the PR can lead to a lack of context. Always explain what the PR is about, why it’s necessary, and include relevant background information to ensure a smoother review process.

#### 4. Skipping Tests

In the rush to deliver, testing can be overlooked, leading to future bugs. Ensure your changes are covered by appropriate tests, whether unit tests, integration tests, or manual checks, to maintain code quality.

#### 5. Skipping Self-Review

Before submitting, take a few minutes to review your own code. This helps catch errors and optimize logic, leading to a smoother review process for everyone.

#### 6. Poor Communication

Effective communication is crucial for teamwork, including in PRs. Tag the right people, ask for specific feedback, and respond to comments promptly. Resolve conversations and engage with reviewers to address concerns and improve your code.

#### 7. Pushing Unnecessary Files

Accidentally committing files that don’t belong in the repository is common. Double-check what you’re committing and use .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files, keeping your repository clean.

### Conclusion
Creating a strong pull request is about developing good habits along with good code. By avoiding these common mistakes, you’ll simplify the review process for your team and contribute to a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
